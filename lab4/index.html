			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To create high-level pseudocode of a game or task.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems arose in this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Creating pseudocode is helpful becasuse it creates a framework for the program and possibly create less errors down the line. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Here is the outline to an everyday task</p>
					<pre>
1. Turn on stove
2. Put pan on stove
3. Add butter or oil to pan
4. Add as many eggs to pan
5. Flip eggs if desire
6. Toast bread (two slices)
7. Place egg on one slice of bread
8. Place the other slice of bread on top
9. Eat 
					</pre>

					<p> Here is the outline for a computer game</p>
					<pre>
1. Dealer shuffles cards
2. Each player gets 2 cards
3. PLAYERS TURN
4. Add sum of cards
5. If sums of cards is less than 21, continue
6. Player can hit or stay
7. If sum is greater than or equal to game is over
7. If sum is 21 or less, continue to dealers turn
8. DEALERS TURN
9. Add sum of cards
10. Check if 17 or greater
11. If yes, dealer must stay
12. If no, dealer must hit
13. If no one busts, whoever has higher total wins
					</pre>

					<p>Here is the pseudocode for the computer game</p>
					<pre>
//Dealer shuffles cards
//Each player gets 2 cards
//PLAYERS TURN
    // Add sum of cards
    //If sums of cards is less than 21, continue
        //Player can hit or stay
        //If player stays go to dealers turn
    //If sum is greater than or equal to game is over
    //If sum is 21 or less, continue to dealers turn
//DEALERS TURN
    //Add sum of cards
    //Check if 17 or greater
        //If yes, dealer must stay
        //If no, dealer must hit
    //If no one busts, whoever has higher total wins
