			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that I encountered was trying to shuffle the characters in the string/name that the user inputed. I did not know how to shuffle the characters around so I asked for helped. <br> 
					I was pointed towards math.random() which can shuffle the characters in the string and it did work after some tinkering. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was great because we had to start from stratch. There was no training wheels on this lab so it was fun creating files, writing a program that is a little more complicated than the previous labs. <br>
					It was also fun trying to solve some of the bonus tasks. It made it more challenging but statisfying to complete even though I was not able to figure out how to upper case the first letter and the letter after the space. </p>
