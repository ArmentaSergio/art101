			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were no problems with this lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Again, it is great practice to create new files for this lab. Experimenting on the console did help out a lot because
                    I was refering to the console to guide me when writing code for the javascript file. <br> Also callbacks seemed daunting (and still do a bit), 
                    but experiementing and implemeting callbacks into the javascript file helped me get a better understanding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Go to the console to see results from javascript file. </p>
					
					<div id="output"></div>
