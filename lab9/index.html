					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose in this lab was during task 3. More specifically the event listener was not working for the buttons. 
					It turns out that it was a simple mistake, <br> as the id names for the buttons and divs from html were not matching with the function headers in javascript. 
					So in other words, a typo was causing me errors. </p>
